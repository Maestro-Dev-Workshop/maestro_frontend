  Hey there mate. What do you think you're doing here? Get back to learning!
  Also you might have noticed the sideways scrollable landing page, weird innit? Oh... you didn't? Because it was patched out? Well that's no fun :(
  Anyways, just keep in mind that you can take the bug out of the code, but you can never take the code out of the bug ;)
